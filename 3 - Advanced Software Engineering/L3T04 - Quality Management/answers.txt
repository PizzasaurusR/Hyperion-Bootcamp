1) Quality Standards
1a) A Mobile Game:
    
    - Performance: Ensures the game runs smoothly across various 
                   devices without lag or crashing.
    
    - UI: Ensure the user easily can understand and use the UI.
    
    - Security: User data must be secured against breaches and 
                unauthorized access.
    
    - Compatibility: The game must work across various platforms such as
                    IOs, Android, phones or tablets.
    
    - Updates: Allows regular maintenance and updates without negatively
               impacting the user experience.

1b) Banking App: 
    
    - Security: The user's data must be robustly secured. This would 
        include, authentication, encryption and protection against any
        data breaches or fraud.

    - Accuracy: The app must be accurate in all calculations and 
        financial transactions. This must be error-free.

    - Reliability: The user must be able to use the app 24/7 with 
        minimal downtime.

    - Compliance: The application must adhere to industry standards and 
        and regulations must be followed.

    - Usability: Is the app easy to use and navigate for the end-user?

1c) Database for a Medical Organization:

    - Security: All patient data must have strict access controls and 
        encryption. 
    
    - Reliability: The data must be accurate and have consistent  
        controls for the addition, manipulation and storage of the data.

    - Compliance: The database must meet HIPAA and any other regulatory
        standards.

    - Scalability: The database must be able to handle large volumes
        of data as the Organization grows.

    - Backup and Recovery: There must be backups and failsafes to ensure
        that the data is recoverable. 

2) A high-quality software process is designed to systematically address
   various aspects of any software development. By taking a structured 
   and careful approach, we ensure that each phase of the development
   process is meticulously planned out and executed. This minimizes the 
   chances that any critical areas of the project are overlooked and 
   ensures a high overall quality for the final product.

   Oftentimes, when using a high-quality process, such as Agile, 
   continuous testing and validation are implemented throughout the 
   development process. This ensures that any defects are identified
   and corrected early. The feedback from the testing also helps 
   maintain high quality and reliability standards. High stakeholder 
   collaboration will also lead to clearly outlined user expectations 
   and requirements. This will in turn lead to a flexible and adaptable
   software product.

   These methods are, however, very resource-intensive including time,
   skilled labor and financial investments. Smaller teams or solo 
   developers will struggle to allocate the appropriate resources to 
   each task. Adhering to all the standards presented by a high-quality 
   process can be strenuous and add an extra level of complexity to any 
   project. This can slow down the development process especially when 
   in an Agile environment. Couple this with the fact that the 
   flexibility in these processes can often lead to scope creep, 
   causing a project to deviate from its original goals.  

   Finally, high-quality processes often rely heavily on skilled 
   personnel. If the team lacks all of the necessary skills, then the 
   process will not lead to the desired outcome.

3) Program inspections are a great way to catch errors in a program 
   because they involve a detailed review of the code by a team of 
   experienced developers, often including those who didn't write it. 
   This helps spot defects like logic errors, code inconsistencies, and
   deviations from coding standards before the code is even run. 
   Inspections are especially good at finding issues that automated 
   tests might miss, like design flaws and requirements mismatches. 
   However, they aren't as effective at catching runtime errors, 
   performance problems, and other dynamic issues that only show up 
   when the code is executed in a real-world environment.

4) Validating the relationships between internal product attributes and 
   external attributes is challenging for a few reasons. Internal 
   attributes, like code quality or modularity, are technical aspects 
   that developers can measure directly. However, these don't always 
   translate neatly into external attributes like user satisfaction or 
   overall product usability, which are more subjective and influenced 
   by a wide range of factors. For example, clean code and 
   well-structured modules should theoretically make a product more 
   reliable and maintainable, but user satisfaction can also depend on 
   factors like design aesthetics and performance under real-world 
   conditions, which aren't always directly linked to internal code 
   quality. 
   
   Additionally, external attributes are often impacted by the context 
   in which the software is used, including the specific needs and 
   expectations of users, which can vary widely and change over time. 
   This makes it tough to draw a direct line between the technical 
   quality of the software and how well it meets user needs in the real
   world.
