1) This is a horrible site.
    Good:
    - It's easy to see where to search the site.
    - Navigation away from the homepage is easy
    - Consistent image use for buttons makes them easy to identify

    Bad:
    - The colours are clashing making it difficult to read the text
    - The background image is jarring and difficult to look at.
    - There is little to no information about the company or its
      product shown.
    - The elements are not in the standard positions, e.g. the logo is 
      not in the corner of the screen. This will make navigation more
      difficult.

2) This is a well-designed site.

    Good:
    - The site is clean and easy to read.
    - Sections are demarcated by different blocks of colour.
    - Text is clearly visible and easy to read.
    - A consistent theme is used throughout the site.
    - The menu is easy to use and it is intuitive to move around the 
      site.
    - Menu features a dropdown list simplifying the design.  
    - Images are used in conjunction with descriptions for product
      catalogues allowing the user to make a more informed choice.
    - Menu is visible throughout the site, no matter how far down on the
      page you are.   

    Bad:
    - Pages are long with no way to quickly travel to the top.
    - There is no search function.
    - There is no contact page option in the top menu, this is only 
      found in the footer.  
    - I feel that the footer is poorly designed. It feels out of sync
      with the rest of the site and could have better flow.
    - I would also put the reviews higher on the page.
