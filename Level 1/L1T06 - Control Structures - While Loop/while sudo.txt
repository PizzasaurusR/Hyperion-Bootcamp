program must take input from user
store input as var usr_input
create var input_count = 0, this is the total number of user inputs
create var run_total =0, total value of user inputs 
create new var avg =0, average

while usr_input is not -1
    add usr_input to var run_total
    input_count += 1
    ask for new input from user and assign to usr_input
    if usr_input == -1
    break

avg = run_total / input_count
print "Your average is " + avg
